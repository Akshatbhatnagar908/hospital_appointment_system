## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-healthcare-assistant.git
cd ai-healthcare-assistant
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook
5. Run the Main Notebooks in Order:
identify_for_disease.ipynb – Disease prediction using patient data

ai_chat bot.ipynb – Healthcare chatbot interface

Other Untitled*.ipynb – Experimental and utility notebooks

📊 Sample Use-Cases
Doctors receive AI-driven disease predictions based on patient symptoms.

The system estimates consultation time for efficient scheduling.

Patients receive automated billing notifications after discharge.

🔮 Future Plans
Integrate with real-time Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems.

Develop a web-based frontend using Flask or FastAPI.

Train models with more comprehensive and diverse datasets.

Implement secure user authentication for medical personnel.
