ai_chat bot.ipynb

Other notebooks for extended features

📊 Sample Use-Cases
A doctor enters symptoms and receives AI-based predictions of potential diseases.

The hospital system estimates consultation duration and adjusts the appointment schedule dynamically.

Patients receive billing alerts automatically after discharge.

🔮 Future Plans
Connect to real-time Electronic Health Records (EHR).

Web interface using Flask/FastAPI.

Model improvements with larger, real-world datasets.

Secure login system for healthcare staff.
